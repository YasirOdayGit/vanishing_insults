# vanishing_insults

A fun flutter project that allow friends to exchange funny insults to one another once a day. Each user is allowed to insult their friends once. Each consecutive daily insult will add to the streak (just like snapchat). 

## Backend

This project will not include the backend logic, though I might implement it in the future. For now, this project is only the frontend.

## Figma files
Figma files were created by me, feel free to use them for inspiration.
